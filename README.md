# Small-sized-VVER-1000-reactor-core-Serpent-2-model-
A compact model has been created for simulating neutronic processes in the VVER-1000 reactor core. Unlike a full-scale core model, this model calculates quickly and yields roughly comparable values. Furthermore, fuel reloading can be implemented in this model.
